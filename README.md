# GuessingTheNumber--Game-
*-> This game generates a random number between 0 to 100 when a new object is created
*-> That object is the player[you], you will be guessing the number computer generated
*-> Computer will guide you. for ex:- RandomNumber = 45, you guessed 43, then computer will say you guessed a smaller number same way again you will guess 47, then computer will say you guessed a bigger number this how you will know the number lies between 43 & 47
*-> Here is the catch, everytime you guess the input, there will be a lives variable will start from zero and will be incremented by 1 as you keep guessing
*-> The more lives you take to guess,That more you brain is slow[joke, you r smart]
*-> Try to guess the number in less lives using
